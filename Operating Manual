Can read all sorts of pdf and text files(not word doc).
Please keep the executable file within the same folder of other supporting files. Use full path to the selected file along with the file name and then specify the extension(.pdf or .txt).Suggested to keep the pdf of text file in a drive so that file location is simple(Say-> E:\\(filename).pdf).One can find the file location from the dialog box just above the folder space(the dialog box that has a folder symbol...a small rectangular column
Any error in the name of the pdf or text file will shutdown the terminal immediately
So pls follow the following format|| (full path to that file)\\(file name as it is).(pdf or txt).
Using file extension is very important.
